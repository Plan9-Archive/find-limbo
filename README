# intro

find lets you traverse directory trees and print paths and sys-stat(2)
information about a file.  it is intended to use than alphabet-fs(1)
and/or du(1) with various combinations of grep, sed and for-loops
with ftest(1).  find's usage is different from the unix version
(most importantly, it uses standard option syntax).


# install

change the "mkconfig" if you do not have $ROOT set.  now "mk install"
to compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
